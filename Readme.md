# U.S. Championship V'ball


This is the emulation of V'Ball from Technos Japan ported to MiSTerFPGA by Pierre Cornier (Pierco). The core uses SDRAM for background tiles & DDRAM for PCM data, loaded automagically from mra.

The default joystick mapping is:

| Name   | Button |
|--------|--------|
| Coin A | R2     |
| Coin B | L2     |
| Jump   | B      |
| Action | A      |
| Start  | Start  |
